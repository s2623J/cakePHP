    Notes:
    ------
    CakePHP Definition: PHP MVC framework

    Installation:
        Install XAMPP with: "https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html"
        Install Composer with: "https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe"
        Install CakePHP with: "composer create-project --prefer-dist cakephp/app:~4.0 my_app_name"
        Browser navigate to: "http://localhost/cakePHP/cake_php_course/"
        Ensure "tmp" and "logs" folders aare writeable (affects performance)
        Customize credentials for MySQL DB in app_local.php lines 47 - 52
            
    Naming Conventions:
        Controller class names are PascalCase, and end in Controller
            (ie. "UsersController" and "MenuLinksController")
        URLs are lowercase and dashed using the DashedRoute class
            (ie. "/menu-links/view-all" == MenuLinksController::viewAll())
        Table names corresponding to CakePHP models are plural and underscored
            (ie. "users", "menu_links", and "user_favorite_pages")
        Table class names are plural, PascalCase and end in Table
            (ie. "UsersTable", "MenuLinksTable", and "UserFavoritePagesTable")
        Column names with two or more words are underscored, for example, first_name.
        View template files are named after the controller functions they display, in an underscored form
            (ie. The "viewAll()" function of the "ArticlesController" == "templates/Articles/view_all.php")
        Plugins are prefixed with “cakephp-” in the package name. Example:
            // Bad                  // Good
            cakephp/foo-bar         your-name/cakephp-foo-bar

    Routes:
        Route path name should be based off of the action name

    VsCode:
        Pressing "Ctrl" + mouse-clicking the class method, will open the page 
            and method location in deditor

    Layouts:
        Require HTML "helpers" to link all the required resource files (ie. CSS, JS, etc)

    Templates:
        Elements:
            Reusable
            Like "mini-views"
            Can accept parameters
            Placed in the "templates/elements" folder
            Generated from static method of View.php
                All details of Element are detailed in comment section
            Element file returns markup with template variables
            Example:
                <?php echo $this->element('jumbotron.php'); ?>
                Cake\View\View::elements(string $elementPath, array $data, array $options = []);
        Blocks:
            Define Blocks/Slots in a layout 
            Unlike elements, there may be many blocks contained in a single block file
            Blocks are defined with PHP tags:
                Example:
                    <?php $this->start('block_name') ?>
                        // Bock Definition here 
                    <?php $this->end(); ?>
            Block are specifically called with a FETCH command:
                Example (need BOTH):
                    <?= $this->element('headings') ?> <!-- Pulls in heading block(s) page -->
                    <?= $this->fetch('heading1') ?> <!-- Pulls in specified block -->
        Cells:
            Use view logic
            Act as mini controllers that render templates
            Built with extending the "Cell" class
            Used as components when interacting with:
                View logic (namespace source>view>cell) (ie. cell controller)
                Rendering (namespace templates>cell>data) (ie. cell view)
                Layout (namespace templates>layout>custom) (ie. template)
            Example: shopping cart

    Images:
        Should use a base_url constant. Preferably derived as a global constant from paths.php

    Application Helpers:
        Reference: https://book.cakephp.org/4/en/views/helpers.html
        Load custom helpers in the AppView.php page in the view folder
        Helper Types:
            Breadcrumbs
            Flash
            Form
            Html
            Number
            Paginator
            Text
            Time
            Url
        Flash Messages:
            Documentation: https://book.cakephp.org/4/en/views/helpers/flash.html#namespace-Cake\View\Helper
        UrlHelper:
            Helps generate urls with 4 methods:
                build
                image
                script
                css
            Used to create a url containing everything but "http://localhost"
            


    Tips:
        These are the same:
            <?php echo $this->element('jumbotron'); ?>
            <?= $this->element('jumbotron'); ?>
