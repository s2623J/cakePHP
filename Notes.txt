    Naming Conventions:
        Controller class names are PascalCase, and end in Controller
            (ie. "UsersController" and "MenuLinksController")
        URLs are lowercase and dashed using the DashedRoute class
            (ie. "/menu-links/view-all" == MenuLinksController::viewAll())
        Table names corresponding to CakePHP models are plural and underscored
            (ie. "users", "menu_links", and "user_favorite_pages")
        Table class names are plural, PascalCase and end in Table
            (ie. "UsersTable", "MenuLinksTable", and "UserFavoritePagesTable")
        Column names with two or more words are underscored, for example, first_name.
        View template files are named after the controller functions they display, in an underscored form
            (ie. The "viewAll()" function of the "ArticlesController" == "templates/Articles/view_all.php")
        Plugins are prefixed with “cakephp-” in the package name. Example:
            // Bad                  // Good
            cakephp/foo-bar         your-name/cakephp-foo-bar

    Routes:
        Route path name should be based off of the action name
